# Random Person API
## REST API created with Java + Spring Boot

### About

I've created this API for a user to be able to retrieve a person with randomized attributes. I programmed it in Java, and utilized the Spring frameworks tools for creating REST API functionality. When calling a GET request to the end-point, it will return a JSON object with a random first name, last name, email address, age, phone number, street address, city, state, and zip code.

### How To Use

To call my API, make a GET request to ```https://randomperson-api.herokuapp.com/person```
